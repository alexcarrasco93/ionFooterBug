# ionFooterBug
project for ionic issues
This project has the example to repreduce the bug which is that when you have an input or ion-input with a long text inside a ion-footer in a built project when you tap the input the cursor won't place to the end of the text inside the input and if you are in an iOS device won't either scroll or navigate inside the input to edit the part of the text that you don't see.
